<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This class has a dual purpose: It can be used to create permutations of a given
size and to do some simple computations with/on permutations.
</p>
<p>
The instances of this class don't require much memory because they don't
include the permutation as a data structure. They only save the information
necessary to create the permutation if asked to do so.
