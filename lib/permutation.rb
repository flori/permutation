#
# == Description
#
# This class has a dual purpose: It can be used to create permutations
# of a given size and to do some simple computations with/on
# permutations. The instances of this class don't require much memory
# because they don't include the permutation as a data structure. They
# only save the information necessary to create the permutation if asked
# to do so.
#
# To generate permutations the ranking/unranking method described in [SS97]
# is used. Because of Ruby's Bignum arithmetic it is useful also
# for permutations of very large size.
# 
# == Examples
#
# In this section some examples show what can be done with this class.
#
# Creating all permutations and project them on data:
#
#  perm = Permutation.new(3)
#  # => #<Permutation:0x57dc94 @last=5, @rank=0, @size=3>
#  perm.map { |p| p.value }
#  # => [[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]]
#  colors = [:r, :g, :b]
#  # => [:r, :g, :b]
#  perm.map { |p| p.project(colors) }
#  # => [[:r, :g, :b], [:r, :b, :g], [:g, :r, :b], [:g, :b, :r], [:b, :r, :g],
#  #  [:b, :g, :r]]
#  string = "abc"# => "abc"
#  perm.map { |p| p.project(string) }
#  # => ["abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"]
#
# Or perhaps more convenient to use:
#
#  perm = Permutation.for("abc")
#  perm.map { |p| p.project }
#  # => ["abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"]
#
# Finding the successor and predecessor of Permutations or a
# certain Permutation for a given rank:
#
#  perm = Permutation.new(7)
#  # => #<Permutation:0x8453c @rank=0, @size=7, @last=5039>
#  perm.succ!
#  # => #<Permutation:0x8453c @rank=1, @size=7, @last=5039>
#  perm.succ!
#  # => #<Permutation:0x8453c @rank=2, @size=7, @last=5039>
#  perm.succ!
#  # => #<Permutation:0x8453c @rank=3, @size=7, @last=5039>
#  perm.pred!
#  # => #<Permutation:0x8453c @rank=2, @size=7, @last=5039>
#  perm.rank = 3200
#  # => 3200
#  perm
#  # => #<Permutation:0x8453c @rank=3200, @size=7, @last=5039>
#  perm.value
#  # => [4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 0, 6]
#
# Generating random Permutations
#
#  perm = Permutation.new(10)
#  # => #<Permutation:0x59f4c0 @rank=0, @size=10, @last=3628799>
#  perm.random!.value
#  # => [6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 5, 8, 1, 2, 0]
#  perm.random!.value
#  # => [3, 7, 6, 1, 4, 8, 9, 2, 5, 0]
#  perm.random!.value
#  # => [2, 8, 4, 9, 3, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1]
#  perm.random!.project("ABCDEFGHIJ")
#  # => "DFJGAEBCIH"
#  perm.random!.project("ABCDEFGHIJ")
#  # => "BFADEGHJCI"
#
# Performing some mathematical operations on/with Permutations
#
#  p1 = Permutation.from_cycles([[1, 3, 2], [5, 7]], 10)
#  # => #<Permutation:0x593594 @rank=80694, @size=10, @last=3628799>
#  p2 = Permutation.from_value [3, 2, 0, 5, 6, 8, 9, 1, 4, 7]
#  # => #<Permutation:0x5897b0 @rank=1171050, @size=10, @last=3628799>
#  p3 = p1 * p2
#  # => #<Permutation:0x586a88 @rank=769410, @size=10, @last=3628799>
#  p3.value
#  # => [2, 1, 0, 7, 6, 8, 9, 3, 4, 5]
#  p3.cycles
#  # => [[0, 2], [3, 7], [4, 6, 9, 5, 8]]
#  p4 = p1 * -p2
#  # => #<Permutation:0x581a10 @rank=534725, @size=10, @last=3628799>
#  p4.value
#  # => [1, 5, 3, 0, 8, 2, 4, 9, 7, 6]
#  p4.cycles
#  # => [[0, 1, 5, 2, 3], [4, 8, 7, 9, 6]]
#  id = p1 * -p1
